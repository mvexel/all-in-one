## Reverse Proxy Documentation

Basically, you need to specify the port that the apache container shall use and modify the startup command a bit.

All examples below will use port `11000` as example apache port. Also it is supposed that the reverse proxy runs on the same server like AIO, hence `localhost` is used and not an internal ip-address to point to the AIO instance. Modify both to your needings.

**Info:** The instructions below assume that your reverse proxy is installed directly on the host, not inside a separate docker container. If you want to run the reverse proxy inside a docker container, you can do so by using the `--network host` option when starting the reverse proxy container.

### Reverse proxy config examples

#### Caddy

<details>

Add this to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:443 {
    header Strict-Transport-Security max-age=31536000;
    reverse_proxy localhost:11000
}
```

Of course you need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud.

#### Nginx

**Disclaimer:** the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. See e.g. https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/issues/450, https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/issues/447 and https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/issues/491. Improvements to it are very welcome!

Add this to you nginx config:

```
location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:11000;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        # Websocket
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }
```

Please note that the `$connection_upgrade` is not defined in a default `nginx` configuration. You will need to add it to your `nginx.conf`. Please see [this nginx blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/) for details.

Of course SSL needs to be set up as well e.g. by using certbot and your domain must be also added inside the nginx config.

### Startup command

After adjusting your reverse proxy config, use the following command to start AIO:

```
# For x64 CPUs:
sudo docker run -it \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e APACHE_PORT=11000 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

<details>

<summary>Command for arm64 CPUs like the Raspberry Pi 4</summary>

```
# For arm64 CPUs:
sudo docker run -it \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
-p 8080:8080 \
-e APACHE_PORT=11000 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest-arm64
```

</details>

On macOS see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-it-on-macos.

<details>

<summary>Command for Windows</summary>

```
docker run -it ^
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer ^
--restart always ^
-p 8080:8080 ^
-e APACHE_PORT=11000 ^
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config ^
--volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro ^
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

</details>

After doing so, you should be able to access the AIO Interface via `https://internal.ip.of.this.server:8080`. Enter your domain that you've entered in the reverse proxy config and you should be done. Please do not forget to open port `3478/TCP` and `3478/UDP` in your firewall/router for the Talk container!

### Optional

If you want to also access your AIO interface publicly with a valid certificate, you can add e.g. the following config to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:8443 {
    reverse_proxy https://localhost:8080 {
        transport http {
            tls_insecure_skip_verify
        }
    }
}
```

Of course, you also need to modify `<your-nc-domain>` to the domain that you want to use. Afterwards should the AIO interface be accessible via `https://<your-nc-domain>:8443`. You can alternatively change the domain to a different subdomain by using `https://<your-alternative-domain>:443` in the Caddyfile and use that to access the AIO interface.
